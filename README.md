Hello there!

I'm Ricardo and I'm a Mobile Tech Lead at [Blerify] and a Web3 enthusiast!

I have BSc degree in Computer Science at State University of Maring√° ([UEM]) and I've got a taste of many areas over the last few years: from building embed systems to designing APIs. I also helped to develop some nice AI solutions using Image Processing and Natural Language Processing techniques.

I am deeply passionate about mobile and I've been working with **[Flutter]** since 2018.

Feel free to contact me via [LinkedIn] or [Twitter].
